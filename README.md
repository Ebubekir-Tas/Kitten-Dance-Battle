# Project-Dance-Battle
This is a project in development of a Dance Battle game. There are two players, left and right. Player 1 spams Z and X on the keyboard while player 2 spams N and M
on the keyboard, and by doing so will make their character dance. Each input generates a random number from 1-10 and that number is added to the player's total score.
The first player to reach 300 points wins.
